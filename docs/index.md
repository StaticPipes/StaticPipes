## StaticPipes - the unopinionated static website generator in Python that checks the output for you

Most static website generators have technologies, conventions and source code layout requirements that you have to 
follow. 

Instead this is a framework and a collection of pipes and processes to build a website from your source files. 
Use only the pipes and processes you want and configure them as you need. 

If you are a Python programmer and need something different, then write a Python class that extends our base class and 
write what you need.

Finally, when your site is built we will check the output for you - after all you check your code with all kinds of linters, 
so why not check your static website too?
